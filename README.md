# State-of-the-Art Question-Answering Model

## Overview

This project aims to develop a state-of-the-art question-answering model leveraging the Quora Question Answer Dataset. The objective is to create an AI system capable of understanding and generating accurate responses to a variety of user queries, mimicking human-like interaction.

## Dataset

We utilized the Quora Question Answer Dataset available on Hugging Face: [Quora Question Answer Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/toughdata/quora-question-answer-dataset)



## Steps

### 1. Installing Dependencies

Ensure you have all the required libraries installed.

### 2. Importing Dataset

Load the Quora Question Answer Dataset for analysis and model training.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyze the structure and content of the dataset to understand its features and distributions.

### 4. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Remove irrelevant information and apply techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming/lemmatization to prepare the data for model training.

### 5. Model Training and Evaluation

- **Models Tested:** BERT, T5, GPT.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** ROUGE, BLEU, F1-score.
